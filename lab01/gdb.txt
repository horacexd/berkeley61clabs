1. How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb?
	run ext < input.txt (stdin)  || set args <arguments> (set args)
2. How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (e.g. when certain variables are a certain value)?
	break ... if [expr]
3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
	n
4. If the next line of code is a function call, you¡¯ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
	s
5. How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
	c
6. How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
	p
7. How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
	display + var name I want to know 
8. How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
	info locals
9. How do you exit out of gdb?
	q
